I learned about Lasso regression, a regression technique that introduces L1 regularization to the linear regression model. Unlike traditional linear regression, which aims solely to minimize the sum of squared residuals, Lasso regression adds a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the coefficients' magnitude to the cost function. This penalty encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking less influential coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This feature selection capability sets Lasso regression apart from ridge regression, which uses L2 regularization to shrink coefficients without eliminating them entirely. Furthermore, compared to simple linear regression, Lasso regression offers enhanced interpretability through its ability to create more concise models with fewer variables, making it particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing numerous features or potential collinearities.
